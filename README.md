  Video streaming analytics enable content providers to analyze how video players behave and identify problems on certain platforms or devices.  The Common-Media-Client-Data (CMCD) standard defines the format and the types of metrics send from a client to a metric server and database. A user interface build on top of the collected data helps evaluating and structuring the massive amount of information.  Common-Media-Server-Data (CMSD) - not published yet - enables server-side (CDN/origin) communication to the clients. Early implementations are available for experimentation.
